										<p> My name is Dudu Murmani Nikolaishvili, born in Jun 24 of 1999. I have been drawing as long as I can remember, I am a huge fan of animation, and I have grown up with cartoons for most of my life, so I was always curious to see the behind the scenes of them. I dream of being a creator for any visual media, design, create, write, draw, and possibly film whatever story or idea I may have. Everyday new ideas keep floating around my head, and I want to make them become a reality.  </p>
										<p> My inspirations are Hirohiko Araki, a Japanese Mangaka known for his long running series, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. He is one of the most successful mangakas, even having his artwork is in the Louvre. His colorful, dynamic, and distinctive styles make him one of the most recognizable Mangakas in the world. Mike Mignola, an An American Comic Book Artist, best known for his long running comic book series Hellboy. His distinctive artstyle is recognizable for comic book readers, with his spectacular shading style, gothic atmosphere, and superb designs made him as one of my biggest influences. And Jean Giraud, better known under his pseudonym Moebius, was a French artist who has garnered acclaim from his artwork. His use of size, colors, and detail give his artwork an almost ethereal look, making it feel like a dream. He has also worked on various storyboards and concept designs to classics such as Alien, Tron, The Fifth Element and The Abyss.</p>
			</div> 						<p> My greatest hope in life is to create artwork that can influence a huge variety of people to get into drawing and creating what they want.</p>
